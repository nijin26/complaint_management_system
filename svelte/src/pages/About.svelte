        This is a police complaint portal based on blockchain technology,
        focused on improving the Indian police system and promoting transparency
        and accountability in law enforcement. Our platform is designed to
        provide a secure and efficient way for citizens to file complaints and
        for police departments to manage and respond to those complaints.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Our portal is built using the latest blockchain technology, which
        ensures that all data is tamper-proof and cannot be altered or deleted
        once it is recorded. This helps to prevent corruption and ensures that
        all complaints are handled fairly and impartially.
      </p>
